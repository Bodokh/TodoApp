# TodoApp

This is just a very simple ToDo App built with Angular 2 with cli/webpack

## Development server

To run the app localy, clone it on your computer, Open a command line in the root folder, and enter `ng serve` for a dev server. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
